## Models Assessments
The evaluations were made considering the predictions of each model and the true labels (manually labeled). Predictions can be viewed at [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/198oSCLGnTLB17Dp0CIbF7PKdg0le9s58?usp=share_link). The `assessment_pixelbased_model_torch.py` file is used to apply the semantic segmentation models to the CerraDatav3 test set. `pixel_based_assessment.py` is used to evaluate the predictions made by the models. With regard to `model_assessment.py` it is applied to evaluate the performance of contextual classification models.
