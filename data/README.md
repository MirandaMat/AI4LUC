## CerraData dataset

CerraDatav3 has eight types of LULC, containing 80,000 patches, manually labeled via visual interpretation, as done in the second version, [CerraDatav2](https://github.com/ai4luc/CerraData-code-data). The class names, as introduced in Figure below, are based on the thematic mapping of the [TerraClass](https://www.terraclass.gov.br/geoportal-cerrado/) project. In this version the samples were carefully audited by a committee composed of four LULC experts in the Cerrado biome, who are research members of TerraClass, DETER, and PRODES. There are 10,000 patches/class. This dataset can be accessed in [Drive Google](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JBdH4BIjNz4G-RPGF03ODnagXcuCmoPP?usp=share_link).
